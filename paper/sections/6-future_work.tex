\section{Future Work}

Many different tests, architecture and experiments have been left for the future due to lack of time. We can try more CNN and Transformers based models with varying  hyperparameters. As image preprocessing and resizing was one of the main challenges in the project, we might explore different ways of image resizing and augmentation. Ultimately we would like to use a machine with a bigger GPU so that we can increase the minimum image resolution size required for training. We can also expand the segmentation task to melanoma classification to build an end-to-end system.
